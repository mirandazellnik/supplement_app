# BlueZone Supplement Insights
A full-stack mobile application that provides data-driven supplement insights and recommendations using a large structured product dataset.

I designed and implemented a Flask (Python) REST API to support data ingestion, validation, and querying over 300,000+ supplement records stored in PostgreSQL. The backend exposes endpoints consumed by a React Native mobile frontend, which presents searchable supplement information and insights to users.

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation between API logic, data models, and frontend UI state. The backend is deployed on Railway, and the project was developed using Git for iterative feature development.
